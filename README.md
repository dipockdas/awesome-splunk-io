# awesome-splunk-io
A repository of Splunk apps to get data in or generate data


If you are new to Splunk finding the right tools to create data or ingest data can be time consuming and often hit and miss, using time you don't have.

I've put this short list of tools together that will help you fast track your data onboarding experience with Splunk. It's not a definitive list - but will help you cover the basics. 

This repo comes in two forms 

- hyperlinks to the app on Splunkbase
- zip of apps if you want to save time downloading the apps


## Data
- [Eventgen](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1924/) (generate fake data for testing)
- [REST API Modular Input](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1546/) . (poll data from a REST API)
- [Website Input](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1818/) . (scrape web pages)
- [Protocol Data Inputs](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1901/) (ingest data using multiple protocols)
